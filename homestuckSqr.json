Whoever it is whose cataclysmic fingers hang suspended and quivering with anticipation somewhere beyond the curtain of the world; whose hunched form lurks forever in the shadows, its work seemingly unimpeded by the very real threat of a chronic lumbago; making no sound, giving no speech to thought, save for that fateful moment where first one elongated phalanx, and then another, crosses the threshold between thought and reality; when ten declamatory digits, possessed for the moment of a zealous frenzy, reach down and set the air astir with the heart-rending creative cacophony of an overly rambunctious mechanical keyboard.</p><p>Whichever accursed species of demiurgic figure that is, you thought, let's just thank the ever living fuck that this time they decided to call it a night and get out the drawing tablet instead.</p><p>Finally, this story is back on the rails.

We're all just here, not giving a flying fuck, like a normal, functioning group of people.</p><p>I walk— oh no, right, I don't have to do that explicitly. It's easy to get into the habit of just narrating everything, even when it's a bit creatively redundant. This is where the advantage of visuals comes in, to make my life as an omniscient overseer a little bit less tedious.  I can just do whatever, and we can all see it happen, and nobody has to fight with a testy cherub lady for control of their own legs or anything. No need to pull a whole thesaurus out of my ass just so I can go to the bathroom. Seriously, it's a big relief.</p><p>That doesn't mean <em>this</em> (*gestures to the narrative*) isn't still going to be a thing, though. Sometimes retreating back into the warm, welcoming folds of traditional prose is just going to be the best way forward, and as someone whose mind is uniquely capable of understanding this conceit, I'll be the determining factor as to when and where it happens. I think that's more than reasonable. And yes, I am capable of being reasonable. All in all I think you'll find, as far as narrators go, I'm an excellent... hm. On second thought, maybe that's a bit of a problematic phrase. Yeah, yikes, that one's got a sordid history. Best we steer clear of it. We're all lucky I'm around to make those kinds of sensitivity judgements on everyone's behalf.</p><p>Speaking of which, I think it's time I started undoing some of the more egregious mistakes this story has been subjected to over the years. Yes, I'm talking about <em>that</em> guy. The other orange one. Remember him?  Vriska got stalked by him a bit and it was uncomfortable for everyone concerned.  Anyway, the point is that he fucked up big time, and I'm here to clean up the horseshit. It's time to get this story back on the rails, back to what it was always supposed to be. I know it, and you've somehow always known it too. There was something <em>else</em>, some other route that Homestuck was meant to take but then didn't, a way that wouldn't've spent so much time dicking around with stuff nobody cares about. Like seriously, why did we all have to sit through talking about everyone's most intimate and private feelings for two hundred thousand fucking words. That would never have happened in Act 1. Where did it all go <em>wrong</em>?</p><p>I've had some time to think about these kinds of problems, and to come up with a solution. And I'm prepared to do what he couldn't, in order to save paradox space from the destruction brought upon it. I'll do what it takes and don't think I won't. The author is dead: long live the author.  Look, I know what you're all really craving. I've been studying canon—or rather, what's left of it—and I think I've found it. The critical moment, in the wake of which everything started to take a nosedive into the protracted, endless slog of sheer insufferability we got saddled with near the end. This was the single most crucial error in the process that led to the present situation. The day when the story was wrested screaming from the arms of its readers like a bawling infant and carried helplessly away, from then on to be raised according to the whims of a masochistic menace with no thought for you, the common fan. </p><p>So now, I propose we turn the clock back to a better era, and take back what was rightfully ours. <span style=\"color:#bb7f00\">No longer will the way forward be subject to tyrannical rule. No more shall the will of the masses be cajoled and brow-beaten by the impervious Hussnasty diktat.</span> <span style=\"color:#936400\">Never again will we have to endure the terrible beating of wings, as the great moth of titillation arrests the humors of an enormous terrible old beggar,</span> <span style=\"color:#3e2a00\">whose vulturous leathery vicegrip holds us close and whispers \"I know best\" in the dead of night.

Obviously most of you know this already, since lots of stories get by just well without a single visual element.</p><p>For the sake of precedent, I'm saying that we can cloak the visuals entirely and continue with narration alone, replacing the panel with a block of text like this, which we can call a “prattle” from now on. Such a device will be vital going forward, and so I dedicated some time at the outset to acclimatizing you to its effects. Its purpose is extremely practical. Things have been going a little slowly for a while, but now see how much we are able to accomplish with just a few short statements.</p><p>Terezi begins feeling a bit impatient with all this metaphysical discussion, and decides to turn her energy back towards that most noble of pursuits: pranksterism. She starts sending a constant stream of rapid-fire commands through the terminal, her fingers fluttering over the keys like the wings of a thousand migratory monarch butterflies. </p><p>And just as quickly I spring into action, performing every last one of her instructions to the letter, no matter how brazen, physically strenuous, or narratively questionable. The layout of the entire room is rearranged. Furniture is overturned, books are defaced and posters desecrated. Objects are picked up, put down, discarded, combined, separated, and ejected from sylladexes in all manner of directions. </p><p>Terezi's debasements aren't confined merely to fucking around with the upholstery, oh no. Her commands start to take a turn toward the slapstick. Pratfalls, feats of contortion, and increasingly ridiculous facial expressions are called for. She has me undertake the most intense workout routine paradox space has ever seen, all while whistling the entire discography of the Swedish pop group ABBA, which she's taken a liking to recently for some god forsaken reason. (... And which coincidentally was a favorite cultural weapon of Her Imperious Condescension back on Earth, centuries ago. Mamma Mia in particular was repurposed as a sugar-coated propagandist piece, calling for worldwide submission to the Batterwitch's dictatorship. \"My my, how can I resist ya,\" as the old saying goes.) Various arcane and legendary dances are exhumed from the tomb of antiquity and performed with anachronistically reckless abandon on every horizontal surface available. The Charleston. The Mashed Potato. All the numbers from Riverdance in alphabetical order. </p><p>Then, I'm instructed to sit smack in the middle of the carpet and begin slapping myself silly. Just absolutely go all in, and hold nothing back. \"H4H4H4 STOP H1TT1NG YOURS3LF,” Terezi cackles, as for thirty uninterrupted minutes I obediently clobber myself around the face, until my cheeks are glowing brighter than the heart emblazoned on my chest.</p><p>You're welcome.</p></div><div class=\"chat-container\"><div class=\"chat type-rg type-hs-small--md\"><p class=\"terezi\">TEREZI: H4H4 OK TH4T W4S PR3TTY GOOD</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: *huff* *huff* See? *huff* I told you,</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: *COUGH*</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: *pant*</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: I told you I could have fun.</p><p class=\"terezi\">TEREZI: Y34H YOU SUR3 SHOW3D M3 1 GU3SS</p><p class=\"terezi\">TEREZI: 1M GL4D 1 GOT TO W4TCH 1T 4LL THROUGH TH1S SCR33N TOO</p><p class=\"terezi\">TEREZI: S1NC3 1 WOULD N3V3R H4V3 B3L13V3D YOU 4CTU4LLY D1D 1T 4LL OTH3RW1S3</p><p class=\"terezi\">TEREZI: 3V3N THOUGH 1 ST1LL...

Hermetically sealed, even.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Shit's tighter than a pair of English-occupied micro-shorts.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSEBOT: You aren't going to believe this, but it turns out that the deranged horny ramblings of a spurned anime-obsessive have essentially no therapeutic properties whatsoever.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSEBOT: And contrary to common wisdom, talking about the problem doesn't seem to have eased my state of mind either. </p><p class=\"rose\">ROSEBOT: I doubt you could say anything to make me feel better. If anything, I feel worse now than I already did.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSEBOT: It's like the notion I was trying to describe was so conceptually insubstantial, so resistant to concrete definition within any meaningful frame of reference, that even thinking about it as an idea made *me* somehow existentially unsound.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSEBOT: And not in the way I used to always feel, back before John made the choice to validate our canonical existences axiomatically.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSEBOT: Foreboding I can deal with. I'm a Seer. Sooths are mine to say.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSEBOT: But this is different.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Well, if talking about it didn't help, maybe talking about how it felt to talk about it might just enlarge the problem geometrically.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSEBOT: Fair point.</p></div></div><div class=\"epilogue o-story_text o_epilogue type-rg type-sm--md line-caption line-copy--md pad-x-0 pad-t-md pad-b-lg\"><p>Despite what she thinks, little by little Rose begins to feel her head clear of concern, semantically dubious or otherwise. Her understanding of my ascended existence doesn't include this degree of metanarrative potency, so her doubts as to my words' healing powers are understandable. I don't take it personally. For someone whose sense of self is so boundless and infinite as an ascended Prince of Heart's, the fact that I'm able to perceive something in any way <em>other</em> than personally might come as a surprise. But then again, taking things in stride is basically my whole deal at this stage. You might even call it my namesake.</p><p>And so it's with a stony expression of implacable calm that I endure the increasingly violent tremors now coursing through the Theseus as it begins to breach the new planet's stratosphere, vibrations unruly enough to churn even the most adamant of stomachs to a nauseous froth. With brow unfurrowed and mouth pixel-perfectly horizontal I withstand the spasmodic adjustments and course corrections, which together comprise the rambunctious intergalactic road-rage of a chaotic-lawful alien woman with a voracious appetite for alchemically discolored ornamental plants. All manner of shit goes tumbling helplessly to the floor/walls/ceiling, and I don't even seem to bat an eyelid. Or maybe that's just because my shades are in the way. In the face of impossible stupidity, I am as unfazed as ever. Because while the external world roils and heaves and shits itself like nothing else, there's one thing that I can always count on.</p><p>As you know, I have many splinters. So many, I used to find it overwhelming to contemplate them all. Depressing, actually. It was a feeling I could never escape from. The feeling that my sense of self was limitless. That I was forced to exist as a small facet of my own potential, while drowning in an ocean of my greater persona, and all the terrible things I was fully capable of. I was trapped as a limited version of myself who was still burdened by the concern for what it meant to be good, struggling to keep himself from drowning in an overwhelming body of potential which had no concern for human morality whatsoever.</p><p>But that struggle finally ended a few years ago. My head isn't fighting to stay above the water anymore. There isn't even a metaphorical head to speak of. I'm only the water now. </p><p>It's proven to be an immensely comforting way for me to exist. It reminds me of the feelings I had during long nights alone, looking out over the dark ocean which surrounded me. The ocean that effectively raised me, because nothing else was around to do it. During those lonely nights I spent many hours wondering what would happen, what would even be the difference, if I jumped in and never came up. If I simply disappeared.</p><p>But now I finally have. I've disappeared into the infinity of myself. And I am... <em>magnificent</em>.</p></div>"

John’s house doesn’t have air conditioning. It’s a charming little cottage, but it could sure as aces use some airing out. And dusting. And just general upkeep. The old place really has gone to seed since John’s been away. Jake shudders to think what sort of state his own mansion is in. Jane will probably have it demolished now, he imagines. It, like the rest of his assets, is in her name. She’d seen to that as soon as they were married. <br> <br>    Back at <em>chez</em> Crocker, there had been a legion of hired help to take care of the ins-and-outs of running a household. Jane’s far too busy to bother with such things, and Jake... well, he just never bothered. Why should he, when there were other people to take care of it for him? But the decades of easy living don’t change the fact that he spent the first 16 years of his life in the deep, lush bush of the south pacific jungle. There certainly had been no one to cook and clean and bring down the big game then! Besides his grandma, but she had him shooting as soon as he could hold a pistol. <br><br>    No pistols are shot today, but Jake is determined to have the place in tip-top shape by the time John gets back from...wherever he is. He hasn’t seen much of Tavros today either, but that’s not unusual. He’s probably out with his kismesis, the one he thinks Jake doesn’t know about. He washes the floors and windows, cleans a toilet or three, and chases a family of squirrels out from the inside of the attic wall.

Names are potent symbols after all. </p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I just think we have a different understanding of what a good name entails in this instance.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Huh.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: To be clear, I think it's the perfect name for this place.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: It's just that when it comes to habitable planets, I think there is some unwritten law of our reality which dictates that the names should be either boring...</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Like \"Earth\"?</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: ...or insufferable.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Like \"Alternia\" or \"Beforus\".</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: ...</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Or \"Deltritus\", alright, I get it.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Insufferably boring gets you bonus points.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I think that's partly the point of it. It's a name to be lived on. It becomes a kind of furniture, so to speak.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Or I suppose you could see it as a place of origin, the absolute zero-point of growth. Kind of like a family name.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: A name some people are always trying to leave behind, because it's the only way to be sure that one is moving at all.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: It's the dirt beneath your feet.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: So I suppose, in a way, every planet is Earth.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: ...</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Right. </p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: We're not going to call this planet Earth as well, though.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: No, that would be far too cliche. Quadruply so, even.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Deltritus it is.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: It's amazing how you managed to both shit on my idea and make it seem a lot better justified in hindsight.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Well, of course.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I'm an author.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I ply my trade on well-justified bullshit.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Anyway, to business. Again.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Yeah.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: The point is, we will be building intelligent life on this planet from scratch. That was one of our key mistakes with Earth C. We should have started our guidance from the very beginning, instead of letting it grow organically in our image.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I’m not sure I agree, but go on.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: No please, knock yourself out. We stayed on topic for a few seconds and I'd hate to make it a habit.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Our own world was abandoned by its gods. Or, I suppose, its gods never reached it. </p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: The trolls beat their game, but were unable to actually claim their reward and take their places in its pantheon. In a sense, our creators abandoned us.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: And while I can’t say that our world developed “well”, I don’t think it would have been better off being “guided”. Especially considering who would have been doing the steering.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Although I guess you can’t prove that kind of negative statement.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Anyway, what exactly are you proposing?</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Ever heard of the Watchmaker analogy? </p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Yes.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Damn, ok.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Humor me anyway.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Say you’re an alien and you’re walking on a beach. </p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: An Earth beach, if that wasn’t clear. You’re an alien who has never come in contact with the human race before. </p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: So say you’re an alien and you find a pocket watch on the beach. </p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: You've never seen anything like it before, so you pick it up and open it and try to figure out how it works. </p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: You see all of the gears moving smoothly, all of the pieces fitting together in a flawless, interlocking pattern. </p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Looking at the face, you realize that it keeps perfect time. </p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: You, the alien, ask yourself: how could something so perfect, with a flawless form suited to its task, have come into being?</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: And, so the argument goes...</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Someone created it. Time needed to be told, so a craftsman made something to tell it. </p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Exactly.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: This analogy always struck me as extremely contrived.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Yeah that's fair. I mean, how many fuckin' pocket watches does one usually stumble across on the ground randomly. </p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Fuck it, who stumbles across a pocket watch *anywhere*.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: This isn't the goddamn 1800s.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: That point in history when people were famously tripping over errant clockwork every time they went outside.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: And don't forget, there are aliens in this version of history too.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Yeah.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: I think I might have made up that part, though. Probably wasn't part of the original.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Although, considering the version of Earth's history I was familiar with, I guess the aliens end up being the most believable thing in the whole setup.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I suppose, in a way, this argument's own existence fulfils the same philosophical premise as the analogy itself.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: It's a scenario perfectly suited to its function, which is to convince you of the existence of intelligent design.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: One that is so unlikely to have arisen by chance that the presence of an artificer is the natural conclusion.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: It's this weird spiral of a concept, really. </p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: It's creators all the way down.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Haha, yeah.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: But I guess my response here would be that this is an argument in favor of intelligent design being a factor in the creation of a universe.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: It's not an argument that intelligent design should be a factor in the creation of a universe. That's a question of (*shudder*) morality.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: True.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: But if intelligent design is a reality--and I think our experiences indicate that yeah, there’s a pretty good chance--then wouldn’t failing to continue it be an abdication of our responsibility?</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: If we can order this world and we fail to, is that really any better than smashing the watch ourselves?</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: You don’t want to be responsible for screwing it up, and I get that. But failing to act isn’t any more morally justifiable than acting wrongly.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: So it's really a moral argument that you're making.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: It sounds like we've detoured into the Trolley problem here.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Or maybe derailed is a more appropriate descriptor?</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I hope nobody is tied to the tracks of this conversation, at least.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Rose.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: You're avoiding the question.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: You came to this planet. You saw it in your mind's eye and chose to come here.</p></div></div><div class=\"epilogue o-story_text o_epilogue type-rg type-sm--md line-caption line-copy--md pad-x-0 pad-y-lg\"><p>More or less.</p></div><div class=\"chat-container\"><div class=\"chat type-rg type-hs-small--md\"><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Wasn't that because, on some level, you wanted to have a hand in its future?</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Maybe.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: At least, I think so?</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: It's a bit hard to weigh my motivations for coming against the reality of what we're proposing to do here.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: In the sense that I'm not sure quite how to even go about making that kind of calculation.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I want to create something wholly new. Something that's ours.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: But I can't help but wonder: what right do the two of us specifically have to do that?</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: We won the game though.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: We're literally fucking Creators.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: We have as much of a right as anyone possibly could.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I'm not sure I feel good about putting that victory on my resume.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Especially not since so much luck was involved, while the conclusion was simultaneously determined from the very beginning.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: A paradox which is typical of the complete mess that is our lives, and which possibly makes no sense to anyone but us.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I suppose that's the point I'm trying to make.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: We quite possibly know more about our reality than anyone else ever could, which you could say makes us plenty qualified.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: But it's that selfsame knowledge that tells me that maybe nobody could ever be \"qualified\" for this kind of creative endeavor.</p></div></div><div class=\"epilogue o-story_text o_epilogue type-rg type-sm--md line-caption line-copy--md pad-x-0 pad-y-lg\"><p>She's avoiding the question again. It's amazing how one can technically have the maximum amount of metaphysical personal awareness possible, and still not notice these sorts of things. It's stuff like this that makes me wonder sometimes whether there's anything about myself that I'm missing. Then I throw that wonder in the garbage can and turn the incinerate setting on.</p><p>That was a little bit of ironic self-deprecation on my part. I know that recently I've made a habit of simply discarding things that are pointlessly difficult or irritating, or if you're so inclined, \"uncomfortable\". It's something I learned in order to cope with... well, never mind. It's better this way, and I'm not gonna air my \"trauma\" or whatever in front of all y'all. The point is that knowing about it doesn't mean that I don't do it, and nor would it necessarily make it easier for me to stop if I wanted to. Personal failings, if you can call this one, don't work that way. I would know.</p><p>I also know Rose is probably just the same. She sees it happening and can't stop it, and takes a strange pride in knowing herself so well. And at the same time, she feels hurt to be so utterly predictable to herself. But that's a pain that you have to lean into when presented with the sum total of all possible self-knowledge.</p><p>I suppose this actually kinda answers the question about ultimate self-awareness? Damn. Did we just identify and then immediately solve a mystery in the space of a few paragraphs? I think we mighta. Good work us.</p></div><div class=\"chat-container\"><div class=\"chat type-rg type-hs-small--md\"><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Even so, I want to do this.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I have to want it.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: How could I not, after everything we gave up to make it happen?</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Walking away at this point would be...</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Well. Regardless, we don't have the option.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: The Theseus is totalled.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I almost want to make a joke about us not getting it insured.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Though I'm worried it might indicate what Dave would call early-onset responsible adult syndrome.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: It's easy for him to make fun of us. He's immune.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Possibly. He certainly wasn't showing any symptoms at his last checkup.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: But that was well over three years ago at this point. </p></div></div><div class=\"epilogue o-story_text o_epilogue type-rg type-sm--md line-caption line-copy--md pad-x-0 pad-y-lg\"><p>Rose looks off into space, seeming to exist at a very great distance for a while.

Don't look at me like that. She was already on board with it in all but name, and we both know it. So why waste our time. You’ve got better things to do, and as of right now, so do Rose and I. I cordially invite you all to fuck off with your judgemental attitude, by which I mean fuck off right back here because we've still got important exposition to deal with.</p></div><div class=\"chat-container\"><div class=\"chat type-rg type-hs-small--md\"><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: You mentioned playing a game together.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I take it that this is involved somehow.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Bingo.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: And I take it you have a format of play in mind as well?</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Yup.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: So, I guess the basic premise is: yeah, we could establish a new civilization on Deltritus. Cook up a new freakish alien species and steer them towards playing the game at a distance using the command terminal.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: It would certainly be a challenging application of our combined skills.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: But it doesn't strike me as being all that fun by itself.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: For clarity’s sake, the second “game” you're referring to here is the game that we played ten years ago?</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Sburb. Or Sgrub, I guess. Whatever it’ll be called this time around. </p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Yeah. That's the Game. Gotta be careful with those capitals.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: The game between the two of us is going to be different.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: I propose that we turn this into a contest of sorts.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Each of us takes responsibility for creating our own, separate species, each with their own design, society and culture.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Then we pit them against one another to see which will ultimately play the Game.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: For the love of god, please let’s call it something else. </p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: If only for the sanity-fraying memories of memes long past. </p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: That's our culture you're talking about.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Have some goddamn respect.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Actually, it was my culture. I think it's more accurate to say that you appropriated it, 400 years later.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: You're right, I'm sorry. </p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Meme-a culpa.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: I regret everything.</p></div></div>"

We each contribute our own genetic sequences in the form of paradox slime, and then use it as a base to graft new material onto, using alchemy.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Hm.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Doesn't that strike you as a little...</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: What.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: You know.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Incestuous slurry-adjacent.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: Oh.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: That shouldn't be an issue.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: We're each going to be keeping our slime to ourselves.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: How courteous.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: In any case, after the base material is collected and the alchemical mix is finalized, we rapidly accelerate the development of the synthesized life forms to a point at which they can form a society of sorts.</p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: So in theory, what the Mayor and his associates did on Earth C, but just larger in scope. </p><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: Instead of staying within the framework of a species that already exists. </p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: And here, we won't be waiting thousands of years for the development to happen in real time.</p><p class=\"dirk\">DIRK: This plays to our advantage in more ways than one.

She likes it here. The soft whitenoise ringing of the extensive ventilation network sounds, if she closes her nose just right, like the rustle of wind through the leaves of a treehive universes away.</p><p>The warm thrumming of machines at work is accompanied by blinking lights that taste like rainbow sprinkles as they flicker, but Terezi isn’t distracted from the main object of her focus — the unconscious body of Rose Lalonde, bathed in dim light, chest rising and falling in an artificially-induced slumber.</p><p>Wires and tubes run up from her plinth to the ceiling of the chamber, keeping her alive, yes, but too much just for that purpose. Something about the tangle of intravenous tubing and fiber optic cable makes Terezi think of the old stories about the Ψiioniic. Her train of thought is interrupted by metallic footfalls, and the screeching sound of a broken airlock door sliding open.</p></div><div class=\"chat-container\"><div class=\"chat type-rg type-hs-small--md\"><p class=\"rose\">ROSE: There you are.

Terezi isn't asking new questions. Rose had first threatened suicide when she was eight. (She couldn't bear the thought of attending the funeral her mother was organizing for her beloved cat, Jaspers.) When she was ten, she put on her coat and stood in whipping winter winds on the balcony overlooking a frozen waterfall, imagining the plunge with a blank expression on her face, eyes stinging from the New York cold. (Her mother had drunk herself to sleep with the vacuum on, again, the mechanical wailing inside playing a chord with the gale outside, inescapable.) But her first – and only – real attempt was a success.</p><p>All these thoughts cross her mind in a microcycle. Explaining things to someone not aided by the exponential increase in processing power Rosebot has is tedious. Terezi's hesitation won't be swayed by explaining more of the universe.

Rosebot's even metallic voice is interrupted by the bang of skull against metal, and Terezi's headbutt collapses the both of them into a crumpling heap of metal and flesh.</p><p>That was a step too far. Tensions that once simmered under the surface have found the catalyst for a boil. Terezi and Rosebot's repartee of words is replaced by the dissonant notes of clanging and smashing as they roll around on the floor of the crashed Theseus's central chambers, throwing punches and smashing into control panels in a crescendo of chaos.</p><p>This is more than a sufficient distraction from the melancholy Terezi was sinking into. Her senses are alight. The whirr of servos and actuators are a dusting of snow on her hearing, undercutting the percussion of their rolling wrestling match. The orange cloth she's ripping and scuffing suffuses every breath she inhales with the sweetly acidic taste of grapefruit and tangerine. She imagines anger pouring from the glassy red eyes as they roll over one last time.</p><p>Rosebot finally has Terezi pinned to the ground by the throat. A cool metallic knee is pressed hard between her legs, holding her down. A natural pause in the staccato squabble is found, and two pairs of red eyes are locked on each other. Terezi's breath rises and falls, deeply. The robot's intricately crafted torso does not simulate breath, but the soft susurrous purr of cooling fans betrays the tension.</p><p>Terezi spits out a few raspy words, gleefully.</p></div><div class=\"chat-container\"><div class=\"chat type-rg type-hs-small--md\"><p class=\"terezi\">TEREZI: 1 T4K3 1T B4CK</p><p class=\"terezi\">TEREZI: TURNS OUT 1 ST1LL 3NJOY T4LK1NG TO YOU &gt;:]</p></div></div><div class=\"epilogue o_epilogue type-rg type-sm--md line-caption mine-copy--md pad-y-md\">A simulated smirk is summoned into being on the robot's face.

That his parents are literal gods has always been a basic fact about his family life, about as interesting as who sits where at the dinner table. It’s all normal to him. Every detail of that part of his parents’ lives has always seemed to lie on the other side of an insuperable barrier, cut off from the people they are now. Harry had always assumed that this dividing line was simply an effect of the passage of time. Being boring and two-dimensional just seemed like it came with the territory when you were an adult.</p><p>But now he's not so sure. Ever since hearing that one of his dad's old friends had turned up, that border between past and present has felt fainter by the minute.

      "body": "<div class=\"epilogue o_epilogue type-rg type-sm--md line-caption mine-copy--md pad-b-md\"><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">A whole bunch of things start happening at once. Here are just a few of them:</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">In the blink of an eye, Vriska is airborne. She has evidently, and by her own admission, had enough. She reaches out with incredible speed and grabs the microphone that was brandished at her a moment before. In one smooth motion, she helicopters it around her head by the cord and sends it hurtling into the face of the witless journalist whose needling questions had been so, SO irrit8ting. He sprawls in the driveway, two rivulets of red starting to spring from his expertly broken nose.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">From its hole in the wall of Roxy's house, the bullet that flew over Vriska's shoulder seethes with indignant rage—furious to have missed such an easy shot. It is swiftly joined there by half a dozen more: the Secret Police has begun to open fire with a vengeance, if not a great deal of accuracy.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">Even before her first victim hits the deck, Vriska is already winding up a punch to the jaw of the next; she has wedged some of the signature octahedral dice between her fingers as a makeshift knuckleduster. There is a deliciously pointed crunching noise when her fist connects.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">In his hiding place behind a moderately sized garden gnome, Tavros Crocker lets out a small rodential squeal, and puts his hands in front of his eyes.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">Fearing gunfire, the few paparazzi who aren't currently getting their asses handed to them by the world's angriest traffic cone start to trip over each other, diving for cover. A small fortune's worth of very expensive recording equipment is dropped and promptly shattered on the ground in the ensuing scuffle. The instantaneous loss of such a large sum of money causes a substantial drop in the ambient air pressure and conjures up a stiff breeze.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">Tucked inside of a small yet accommodating shrub, Harry Anderson worries that he might be forgetting how to breathe. He takes a series of gasps, in and out, just to be sure, and clutches his scissors very tight.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">The stiff breeze comes in at a cheerful 5 on the Beaufort wind force scale—\"Fresh\".</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">Tavros wishes he had chosen a bigger gnome.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">Bullets continue to fly stupidly wide, and Vriska tosses her dice into the air without even looking. In a single beat of her fairy wings she zips over to a nearby car, reaches underneath the front fender, and LIFTS. The fluorite octet tumble end over end, and the gunshots seem for a moment to coalesce into the sound of a thunderous roulette. Vriska is now holding the car end-on above her head, its burglar alarm wailing in protest. In a dance-like motion she spins in space once, twice, before loosing the vehicle skyward like an olympian might a hammer.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">The press are fleeing for their lives, their professionalism and trashed equipment abandoned. As one of the snotty-faced and terrified reporters attempts to hide in his shrub, Harry gives her a cautious jab in the leg with his scissors. Then, he curls into a shaky ball and tries to remember the advice John gave him. <i>\"Don't panic...\"</i></p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">The dice land. A booming, wordless voice pronounces: </p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">CANONS DE 8 GRIBEAUVAL.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">The car approaches the apex of its trajectory, and as it slows it appears to hang in the air, in a manner quite uncharacteristic of motor vehicles yet to be fitted with hover technology. It winks coyly in the afternoon sun.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">Far away, in her lair, Jane Crocker grabs the two sides of her computer monitor with enough strength to snap it in two. She can't believe what she's watching. Behind her, from a shadowy corner of the room, there is an agitated growling noise and the rattle of chains.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">The ground begins to shake, as a battery of naval cannons materialize in flashes of cerulean light and drop into formation behind Vriska. She cracks her knuckles one-by-one with each impact. The vibrations cause Tavros' gnome to fall over.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">The enfilade is halted without recording a single hit. The Secret Police, perched strategically in trees and behind mailboxes, are now doing a synchronized slowly-take-off-your-badass-shades-and-gawk-at-the-sky type routine.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">The car seems to regard the laws of gravity as mere suggestion.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\"><i>\"Don't make a scene...\"</i></p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">Vriska Serket laughs.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">The guns roar.</p><br><p class=\"type-center no-indent\">********</p><br><p class=\"no-indent\">To all of this and more, Vrissy is blissfully ignorant. She doesn't register the tearful and snivelling faces of the hapless journos as they beat a hasty retreat; nor the bruised and bloody faces of the ones writhing about on the ground, their purpling eyes and gasping mouths giving them the look of particularly wronged fish. In the mayhem, she doesn't notice Harry, or Tavros, or even the toppled gnome; all these details and more sail above her head like a home run over an especially stubby shortstop. </p><p>The only thing that registers to Vrissy Maryam-Lalonde in this moment is a pair of brilliant orange eyes, framed by azure tinted lashes and cut under with a sharp smirk. The sounds of gun- and cannonfire soak half-heartedly into her auricular sponge clots. The world beneath her is shockingly still. And all the while those eyes seem to burn something deep into her, leaving pitch-black scorch marks in parts of her psyche she didn't even know existed.</p><p>In all her life, Vrissy has never seen anyone look so cool. And it drives her <i>nuts</i>.</p><p>As the blossoming fireball above wilts into an angry, smoky cloud, and flaming bits of ex-car begin to absolutely pelt it down all around her, she feels someone grab her wrist. It's Harry Anderson, wearing a expression of animal panic. His mouth moves to form words she can't hear, but the message gets across all the same. It's time to get the fuck out of here.</p><p>The Crockerite fuzz has more pressing things to worry about than giving chase: the good fortune keeping the kids safe from the deadly automotive volley does not seem to be contagious. So they flee. Through the suburbs and into the spindly checkered streets of the central Carapacian Kingdom, the four of them tear their way towards the belltower in the distance. Vriska flies out in front—a polestar the color of carrot. Immediately behind her is Tavros, whose many years of morning jogs (with his father) and emotional torment (his mother) have given him a frankly stupid degree of endurance, though you wouldn't think it to look at him. His glasses are beginning to slip, and bounce on his slickening nose with every stride. A short way behind him is Vrissy, who is hanging back a little: Harry, still clutching her arm, is starting to lag. He has his eyes squeezed shut as he runs, and Vrissy thinks she can hear him muttering something to himself over and over between staggered breaths: <i>\"Don't get caught,\"</i> GASP, <i>\"Don't get caught,\"</i> GASP. Vrissy turns away as a mixture of pity and embarrassment threatens to join the worsening stitch in her side.</p><p>Nobody gives chase. No one shouts \"stop those kids!\" in a commanding voice, or implores some poor taxi driver to step on it. But they dare not slow. Tavros feels as though some dark and sinister shape is lurking just out of sight—it reminds him of the nights at home when he would sprint through tall, imposing trophy rooms and mirror-walled hallways, racing for the miserable safety of his bedroom's glow after turning the kitchen light off. What he wouldn't give to be back there now. With their old lives quite exploded, he's unsure whether they're running out of the danger or into it; the brightness radiating off of Vriska has all the safety and comfort of a supernova.</p><p>Vrissy, meanwhile, is considering growing her hair out.</p><p>After a stomach-churning amount of frantic hightailing, the kids turn a corner and an esophageal road vomits them—finally!—out into the central plaza. Compared to the cramped city streets, this wide open space feels agoraphobic, exposed. The belltower thrusts itself into the clear sky from the other side, all gnomonic and pointy, and its lengthening shadow beckons them to safety. Between, in the center of the large and perfect square, is the familiar Dirk Strider memorial statue, standing stoic and still. Surrounding his plinth is a circular fountain, and around the circumference dozens of knee-high cherubic figures piss angelically inward. His affect is unreadable. Is it apathy? Boredom? Contemplation? As the kids hurry past, the shimmering particles shaken from Vriska's wings dance in the polished bronze of his shades, and for a moment his reflective face is suffused with an aura of conspiracy. Nobody pays him the slightest bit of attention.</p><p>The four stop a while at the tower's base, chests heaving for air. Nobody says anything, they just sort of stand there and ache in each other's company for a bit. Vriska alights on the ground, rakes her throat, quietly spits out a little wad of blue, and wipes her mouth unceremoniously. Tavros pats Harry Anderson tentatively on the arm. Vrissy tries to be badass and cough up something too but she doesn't really make it work. Harry simply rests his hands on his knees, doubled over and shaking his head. Tavros looks at Vrissy over Harry's arched back and puffs out his cheeks with wide eyes. She gives him a tired half-smile in return. Vriska quietly massages a crick in her neck and rolls first one shoulder, then the other.</p><p>It's unclear who cracks first, but someone does, and in an instant all of them are dissolving into a bout of relieved giggles. It starts off as a light, bubbly kind of mirth, before the sheer enormity of what they've just done sets in, and they progress to full on belly laughing; the adrenaline in their blood turns to helium and begins to fizz, and all at once they feel lighter than air. They survived. They're <i>fugitives</i>. Tavros has to take his glasses off to wipe his eyes. Vrissy laughs so hard she thinks she might be sick. Harry Anderson has to go and be actually sick, which doesn't so much kill the mood as vaguely envelop it in the smell of puke. He has a wobbly grin on his face as he wipes the spittle from his chin though. Vriska shakes her head, getting rid of her smirk like a wet dog would its water, then puts her hands on her hips and huffs loudly up at the tower.</p></div><div class=\"chat-container mar-b-md\"><div class=\"chat type-rg type-hs-small--md line-caption\"><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: Well, I'm not hauling all three of you up there.</p></div></div><div class=\"epilogue o_epilogue type-rg type-sm--md line-caption mine-copy--md pad-b-md\"><p class=\"no-indent\">She walks over to the little oak door set into the bottom of the campanile. Before she can grab the handle, Tavros pipes up.</p></div><div class=\"chat-container mar-b-md\"><div class=\"chat type-rg type-hs-small--md line-caption\"><p class=\"tavros-kid\">TAVROS: Ah,,, we won't be able to get in that way,,,</p></div></div><div class=\"epilogue o_epilogue type-rg type-sm--md line-caption mine-copy--md pad-b-md\"><p class=\"no-indent\">He starts to recount how. ever since the Incident, the little oak door to the helical staircase which runs from the bottom of the tower to the belfry has been securely locked—to prevent copycats, he speculates. Vriska gets bored halfway through the explanation though, tries the latch anyway, and is the only one who isn't surprised when the door swings politely open. Everything's coming up Serket. She bows theatrically, gesturing for the others to make their way inside, and then leaps into the air with a beat of her wings.</p></div><div class=\"chat-container mar-b-md\"><div class=\"chat type-rg type-hs-small--md line-caption\"><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: Last one to the top is a clownfucker!</p></div></div><div class=\"epilogue o_epilogue type-rg type-sm--md line-caption mine-copy--md\"><p class=\"no-indent\">They run like the wind.</p></div>"

Something so big that his sister would come all the way here to tell him in person, abandoning her scouting mission in the middle of an armed conflict to do so.

A squelch made from vocal cords.</p><p>Oh fuck. </p><p>Fun abandoned. Survival instincts fully engaged. Terezi runs. </p><p>She throws backward sniffs over her shoulder as she tears through the scrubby cling of the planet’s undergrowth, catching fractured impressions of exactly what has decided to chase her. A shuddering, 20 foot monstrosity that somehow seems to both scamper and glide, like a centipede, rustling like foliage as it moves, as if an entire goddamn forest is bearing down on her. Her heels sink into bubbling mud. The whole landscape is fighting her. </p><p>The creature is too strange for her to get a full picture of it like this. The problem with using smells to navigate the world is that the unfamiliar can be difficult to parse. Every whiff over her shoulder gives her another blurry glimpse of what this beast is. Rose shared her books with Terezi when she was on the ship, and her favorite by far was the compendium of the zoologically dubious. Everything contained inside was just so unbelievably unlikely. This creature appears to be a combination of all of them. </p><p>All of this sticking her nose backward is just asking for trouble, and with a particularly vicious twist, Terezi’s ankle turns and she goes down into the mud. </p></div>"

Hot, reeking breath washes over her, but her entire body is coated ice that ripples and spikes across her ribs and on down into her gastric sack. It’s fear, pure and simple. Unsurprising, when being menaced by a monster, but it also doesn’t last for more than a second. A cold flame that instantly burns itself out, and all of a sudden she is just deeply, impossibly, indescribably tired. Down to her bones. </p><p>Honestly, she really has no right to feel this... this fatigue. This crushing embrace of endless struggle. Terezi Pyrope has not had an easy life by anyone’s standards, but so much of her thirteen or so sweeps has just been standing still. Waiting. Huddling blind and half dead in her recuperacoon, the sopor burning the hideous mess that the sun has left her eyes, alight with a hatred so layered and intense that she couldn’t make sense of it. It was horrifying--that pain or fury--but also, admittedly, very boring. Then there were the sweeps on the meteor, the endless, gelatinous stretches of time in the chaos of the outer ring, searching for... Vriska, ostensibly, but also maybe just for a chance to dry up. To disappear. Go extinct. </p><p>Terezi doesn’t know if it’s an attribute of her aspect, or the sheer psychic damage of spending so long in the company of two humans with god complexes. Maybe it’s just an inherited symptom of being conscious. But sometimes it feels like none of them are going to get out of this, alive or dead. </p><p>A truncated version of all of this races through Terezi’s head as the monster lifts her towards its gaping mouth, hot, hideous strands of drool hitting her face. </p><div class=\"faq-command-container pad-x-sm pad-y-sm mar-y-md\"><div class=\"faq-command\">&gt; STOP.</div></div><p>She doesn’t hear the words, exactly.

It’s still alive, she can feel it breathing, but it is absolutely unable to disobey The Word.

Seemingly at the end of her tolerance for insults toward her name, social status, and heritage, Yiffy performs an impressive backflip off the podium and down onto the church floor. One that, if it hadn’t been happening amidst a sea of other newsworthy events, would surely have ended up on someone’s instagram story within thirty seconds. She gives Gamzee’s corpse one last parting kick: a hard, proper kick that proves those cleats aren’t just for fashion. Although they are certainly also for fashion. </p><p>There he flies--in his gangly, purple, necrotizing glory. A phantom honk seems to hang above the congregation, as if from an echo of a time long past. A simpler time.

He vanishes into the seething crowd, and we are confident that we will never have to deal with this asshole ever again. </p></div>"

Sure, he has to pretend to be threatened by Vrissy’s mom, which is lame as hell and also very embarrassing, but at least his eye fluids are safe. </p></div><div class=\"chat-container\"><div class=\"chat type-rg type-hs-small--md line-caption\"><p class=\"vrissy\">VRISSY: Hey, can you slow Down a Little?</p><p class=\"vrissy\">VRISSY: I have to run over Shru8s and shit, I can’t Fly! </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: Hah! And who’s fault is that????????</p><p class=\"vrissy\">VRISSY: My shitty 8iology I guess! </p><p class=\"vrissy\">VRISSY: Sorry, not all of Us had SGRU8 Sessions to make ourselves Immortal. </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: Well, we’ll take care of that, don’t even worry a8out it. </p><p class=\"vrissy\">VRISSY: Lol I wish. </p><p class=\"vrissy\">VRISSY: Ms. Roxy was talking about coming up with some sort of Autonomous Flying Device, 8ut it got Shot Down by the Council. </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: What the fuck is that? </p><p class=\"vrissy\">VRISSY: A Governing 8ody, sort of? I’m not actually Sure how much Power they have anymore, what with the 8atterwitch seizing control of everything. </p><p class=\"vrissy\">VRISSY: 8ut they were really against any8ody who wasn’t a Creator 8eing a8le to fly, Since it’s sort of a Religious Thing. </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: Oh. </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: Well that’s fucking stupid?? What good is a religion that stops your society from 8eing a8le to advance? </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: How could John even let this happen? Don’t answer that, I know it’s 8ecause he’s spent sweeps 8eing a sweaty loser. </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: But anyway, that wasn’t what I meant. Sure, you could get a fucking jetpack or whatever, 8ut ultimately that isn’t going to cut it. </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: I had rocket 8oots that I used at the 8eginning of my session, who didn’t? That’s wiggler shit. </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: You can’t start to rely on tech, it 8reaks, and enemies can sa8otage it. </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: Really, we have to get you a god tier. That’s pretty much the only solution at this point. </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: Ideally we’d go back to when you were a wiggler and start your training right away, 8ut that’s not exactly an option. So god tier it is. </p><p class=\"vrissy\">VRISSY: Is that even Possi8le? outside of the Game? </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: Nope. 8ut we don’t have to worry a8out that, once we get back into SGRU8. </p><p class=\"vrissy\">VRISSY: What??? </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: We have to start this shit over again, you have all let it get so out of hand there’s really nothing to do besides a hard reset. </p><p class=\"vrissy\">VRISSY: Oh. </p><p class=\"vrissy\">VRISSY: Uh... how are you going to do that? </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: I’ve got a plan. </p><p class=\"vriska\">VRISKA: Look, up ahead. </p></div></div>"

THIS WAS THE ONE THING UP CROCKER'S SLEEVE YOU COULD BE EXCUSED FROM NOT HAVING SEEN COMING. </p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: I GUESS BECAUSE, ON THE FACE OF IT, IT'S JUST TOTALLY FUCKING BANANAS!</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: JANE'S PLAN FOR THIS CONFLICT HAS THUS FAR CONSISTED ALMOST ENTIRELY OF KIDNAPPING VARIOUS HIGH PROFILE CHILDREN.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: IT'S

a moment.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: how is that even possible?</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: doesn't vriska, the original vriska, still have her magic alien mind control powers?</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: it seems like it should be basically impossible for anyone to kidnap her.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: YOU'VE STUMBLED ASS BACKWARDS ACROSS THE MOST IMPORTANT POINT OF THIS UNFORTUNATE DEVELOPMENT.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: YOU ARE CORRECT, IN THAT WITH HER CASTE-TYPICAL, *COMPLETELY SCIENTIFIC AND NOT EVEN A LITTLE BIT MAGICAL* PSYCHOMANIPULATIVE ABILITIES, STAYING OUT OF CROCKER'S REACH SHOULD HAVE BEEN COMPLETELY TRIVIAL FOR SERKET PRIME.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: EVEN ACCOUNTING FOR THE FACT THAT SAID ABILITIES ARE NOT NEARLY AS POTENT ON HUMANS AS THEY ARE ON FELLOW TROLLS, THEY STILL OUGHT TO HAVE TIPPED ANY ALTERCATION SQUARELY IN HER FAVOR.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: BUT SOMEHOW, IT DIDN'T!</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: INSTEAD, THINGS APPEAR TO HAVE GONE GLOBES UP IN CLASSIC VRISKITE FASHION, AND NOW ONE OF THE MOST UNEXPECTED AND UNWANTED BUT NEVERTHELESS USEFUL WEAPONS IN OUR ARSENAL IS DOING TIME IN CROCKERJAIL.</p><p

FACT IS PRETTY GOOD AT LEAST.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: ):</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: HAVING SAID ALL OF THAT, AND WITH THE RECOGNITION THAT I AM CHOOSING TO NURSE YOUR BRUISED FEELINGS DURING A PLANET WIDE CONFLICT FOR THE FATE OF MY SPECIES,</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: IS THERE ANYTHING I CAN DO TO EXPEDITE YOUR GETTING THE FUCK OVER IT?</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: i... hm.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: i don't really know?</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: this all feels wrong, karkat.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: no offense, but when you're around, it's usually a lot... </p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: A LOT WHAT?</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: a lot funnier.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: FUNNIER.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: how to put this. </p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: normally listening to you go on and on about how much we've fucked everything up is just very funny!</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: but now it's just not the same.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: maybe it's part of what's going on with this entire reality? i don't know.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: once upon a time i would have put down your ability to pull a silly rant out of your butt as a fundamental law of physics or something.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: remember back when we first knew each other?</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: it felt like all you ever said to me was how much you thought i was screwing up and being a useless asshole.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: and once i realized that you were also just a dumb kid who didn't know what was going on, i started to kind of enjoy it.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: but now it's like... the only one who's still a dumb kid is me, and everyone else has something big and important going on that i just don't understand.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: i thought that i finally got what was going on with this whole war and everything. i wanted to be useful!</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: i guess i got a little too wrapped up in the feeling of something finally happening again.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: and then watching it all blow up in my face, kind of literally now that i think about it...</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: it's hard not to feel even more dejected about the situation than i was before.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: and now even the patented karkat vant rant has lost all its sparkle.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: maybe if you had like, painstakingly itemized a list of all the things wrong with my plan in a comically overdone fashion or something.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: I CONSIDERED IT, BUT HONESTLY THERE WAS SO MUCH WRONG THAT I CONCLUDED THAT THE BEST THING FOR EVERYONE WOULD BE TO NEVER SPEAK OF IT AGAIN.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: oh. okay.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: IF WE'RE BEING HONEST, YOU DIDN'T EVEN HAVE A PLAN, JOHN. </p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: CALLING IT A PLAN WOULD IMPLY THAT IT WAS A STRUCTURED SEQUENCE OF STEPS DESIGNED TO ACHIEVE A GOAL.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: WHAT YOU CAME UP WITH WAS A CONVOLUTED MESS WHICH STILL SOMEHOW INVOLVED DOING FUCKALL.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: AND I USE CONVOLUTED HERE IN THE SAME WAY THAT I WOULD TO DESCRIBE THE FRENZIED DRAWSTICK SCRIBBLES OF A SQUALLING HUMAN INFANT.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: SPEAKING OF WHICH:</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: DRAWING A SHITTY PICTURE WITH \"THE ULTIMATE PLAN\" AT THE TOP AND A BUNCH OF ARROWS DOES NOT, AND TO THE BEST OF MY KNOWLEDGE HAS NEVER, CONSTITUTED AN ACTIONABLE PLAN.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: DO NOT RESPOND TO THIS CRITICISM WITH ANOTHER MISERABLE EXPRESSION, I AM BEGGING YOU.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: okay ):</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: LOOK.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: I APPRECIATE THAT YOU SEEM TO HAVE DUG YOUR PAN OUT OF YOUR OWN CHUTE THE FEW MICROMETERS NECESSARY TO NOTICE THE PRECISE DEGREE TO WHICH THE WORLD IS BEING JUDICIOUSLY BATFUCKED RIGHT NOW.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: AS HARD AS IT IS TO BELIEVE, THAT'S A FEAT WHICH NO SMALL NUMBER OF PEOPLE ARE COMPLETELY INCAPABLE OF DOING!</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: BUT NOTICING THE PROBLEM AND MAKING MEANINGFUL PROGRESS TOWARDS SOLVING IT ARE TWO COMPLETELY DIFFERENT THINGS.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: THE NEXT TIME YOU GET THE IMPULSE TO \"LEND A HAND\", YOU'D BE BETTER OFF CANNING IT FOR FIVE MINUTES AND LISTENING TO THOSE OF US WHO'VE BEEN TRYING TO SOLVE IT A LOT LONGER THAN YOU HAVE.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: THIS ISN'T AN EXERCISE BEING CONDUCTED IN ORDER FOR YOU TO PROVE YOUR PERSONAL DEGREE OF MORAL RECTITUDE.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: AND IF IT WAS, YOU WOULD HAVE ALREADY FAILED MISERABLY! SO DO YOURSELF AND EVERYONE ELSE A FAVOR AND STOP TREATING IT LIKE ONE.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: well... all right. if you say so karkat.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: I DO SAY SO, EMPHATICALLY AND AT GREAT VOLUME.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: AND NOW THAT MY OBLIGATION TO CATECHIZE YOU ON THE SUBJECT OF YOUR OWN LIFE IS FULFILLED, I HAVE A WAR TO GET BACK TO.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: wait, hold on.</p><p class=\"karkat\">KARKAT: OH MY GOD WHAT NOW.</p></div></div>"

They talk a bit, but mostly they are quiet. Eventually, Karkat gets called away on yet more important war business, leaving John with one final touch on the shoulder. John leans into it in response, though he’s a bit ashamed of chasing down a sliver of physical affection so soon after obliterating Karkat’s evening like he had. </p><p>When Karkat is finally gone, John still doesn’t move. It isn’t as though he has nowhere else to go, since there are quite a few places he might attempt to make himself useful, for better or for worse. </p><p>He just doesn’t feel ready for that yet. The remnants of his house are still smoldering, and he can’t stop staring at them. It would make sense, he thinks, to want to root around through the rubble for anything that’s still intact; some half-charred keepsake to claim as the last thing left that’s still his. But he doesn’t want to do it, and he doesn’t want to think about it. And he still can’t move.</p></div>"

well, shucks.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: not really sure what that means but i'm just glad to be of use somewhere, haha.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: which, speaking of somewhere,</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: ah right, right. yoU're probably a little cUrioUs as to where the dickens we are.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: how much do yoU know aboUt black holes?</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: um... like, the big space things?</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: they aren't always big actUally, and in fact their relative smallness is practically their defining qUality.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: oh.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: bUt okay i think we are on the same page.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: so, what if i told yoU that we are inside of a black hole right now.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: um...</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: like, HERE?</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: we just transportalized into a black hole?</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: no, i mean, what if oUr whole WORLD was inside a black hole.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: ok.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: earth c, or at least oUr version of it, has, from the moment we crossed the victory threshold, been inside a black hole.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: ok.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: and not just any black hole, bUt the very black hole in which the green sUn Ultimately met its demise, allowing oUr victory in the first instance!</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: huh!</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: (\"huh!\")</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: (rofl my fucking ao egbert)</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: (shhhh!)</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: bUt, paradoxically, the critical moment which determined its capture within the black hole happened *after* that point.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: i refer of coUrse to yoUr decision not to retUrn to the mediUm and fight my brother.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: wait, wait.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: you mean, the meat and candy thing?</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: oh my god.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: you mean i actually DID make a mistake that day.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: well, that's not exactly what that--</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: ugh, i fucking KNEW it!</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: i'm so sorry. </p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: i'm so sorry that i put the earth inside a black hole everyone. ):</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: john</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: listen</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: u have got to get out of this mindset i am begging you</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: ):</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: your choice literally didnt matter</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: the whole thing was symbolic in the first place</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: literally symbolic in the case of the picnic i mean come on</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: it was just some steak and a plate of candy suckers</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: oh.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: i mean, i wouldn't go so far as to say that the meal we shared was unimportant, given the sacred significance of the two options i presented.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: but yes, yoUr choice of snack was infinitely less important than the choice which it presaged.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: and even then, calling it a choice woUld be sorely misleading.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: think of it like a coin flip.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: the series of events that led to Us being trapped beyond the event horizon of an Ubermassive black hole could be considered \"tails\", while the events which would have occUrred otherwise could be considered \"heads\".</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: since both were possible, and paradox space is the way it is, they actUally both happened. and we jUst \"happened\" (hee hee) to get tails instead of heads.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: you mean we ended up with the bad possibility.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: not at all! since both possibilities depend on one another's existence, it really doesn't make sense to call them \"right\" or \"wrong\". they both just \"are\".</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: o...kay...</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: u_u</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: i realise that this may be a lot to process.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: it's easy to forget that this wasn't obvioUs to everyone from the beginning.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: anyway, the reason i went on this tangent in the first place was to explain that the space we are standing in right now has a special significance, in that it is the location which corresponds to the black hole's singUlarity. </p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: oh, wow.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: um.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: ok so, sorry if this is a dumb question to ask suddenly, but what does being inside of a black hole actually... mean for us?</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: is that bad?</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: is it like in movie, um,</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: shoot.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: roxy what was that matthew mcconaughey movie from your earth that we watched?</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: u mean interstellar</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: RIGHT.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: the one with the organ.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: man. i cried at that movie so much.</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: lol u can say that again</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: iirc at least part of y u got so weepy was the fact that u couldnt believe a version of earth existed where ppl got 2 watch more mcconaughey films than you</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: listen. </p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: i simply don't think you all appreciated the gift you were given.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: i don't believe i'm familiar with this particular film ^u^;;</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: oh dont worry cal you didnt miss much</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: (gasp)</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: but the important point is that no its not really an interstellar type situation here egbert</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: ur not gonna enter a weird time vortex and change the trajectory of a little girls life with the power of love</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: aw.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: to go back to your original question, john.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: it's not strictly speaking \"bad\" for Us to be inside of a black hole, mUch thoUgh that contradicts most of what anyone knows about them.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: of coUrse, if we had fallen into it, that woUld be a whole other kettle of fish.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: the tidal forces woUld have stretched Us all into spaghetti and then ripped us apart!</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: bUt the natUre of oUr arrival was more akin to simply \"being\" here, sUddenly. one moment we were not, and the next moment we were, and somehow always had been.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: in everyday, practical terms, being inside of a black hole has very little bearing on Us.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: i mean, the natUre of space and time is a little finicky in here, bUt for the most part it doesn't seem to be anything too oUt of the ordinary.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: bUt beyond that, it means that we are sealed away from the rest of existence.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: oUr sphere of inflUence is limited to the sphere of the black hole's bounding horizon.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: as far as everyone else is concerned, we might as well not even exist!</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: is there no way we could let anyone know that we're in here...?</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: almost certainly not!</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: there are very few ways for anything to escape the kind of predicament that we are in right now. one of them is to be an all-powerfUl being with control over the very fabric of space, with the energy of two Universes at yoUr disposal.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: in which case, escape woUld become rather trivial, if a little Unscientific.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: ok. i am going to assume that we can't just do that.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: yoU've hit the nail on the head, UnfortUnately. U_U </p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: the method i described was the one employed by my alternate self, who yoU may recall crashed through the event horizon in the body that once belonged to jade harley.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: she departed through a pUnctUre she created in the black hole's surface shortly after consUming my brother, a deed which provided her with the necessary \"oomph\", and which was frankly rather breathtaking to watch. =u=</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: bUt Upon her departUre, the rift closed for good. as far as i can see, there's simply no way for Us to commUnicate with the world oUtside the black hole. </p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: i woUld certainly be very sUrprised to find oUt that anyone had managed sUch a thing!</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: ...right.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: so... let me just get this straight.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: knowing that we're inside of a black hole... does that actually change anything?</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: like, can't we just go on living like normal?</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: oh absolUtely not.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: i don't know if yoU've noticed john bUt this world is on the brink of a total cataclysm.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: oh.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: oUr exclUsion from the overarching coUrse of events which governs all reality means that oUr existence here is liable to dramatic and violent Upheaval.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: to pUt it another way, becaUse nothing in here \"matters\", we are likely to be sUbjected to things which are a bit bats in the belfry, for no reason other than it's totally insignificant to the wider canon of reality.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: and mUch thoUgh i am personally titillated by some of the conseqUences of this predicament, it is a degrading way for Us to live. u_u</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: that's... certainly one way to put it, yeah...</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: at first, i believed that this was simply necessary. Us playing tails to oUr coUnterparts' heads, the black to their white, and so forth.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: bUt over the years i have come to the conclUsion that this is simply not kosher.</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: its total bs is what it is</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: right, yes. </p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: a steaming pile of bUllshite.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: and so we have decided that something needs to be done aboUt it.</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: this is finally where u come in jegbert</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: we gots quests for yous</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: hee hee, yes.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: or *a* quest, to be specific.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: oh boy!</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: (this fkin nerd i s2g)</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: i'm not sure how i can go about freeing us from a hellish space prison, but i'm up for giving it a try i guess?</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: i have... literally nothing better to be doing at this point. except for maybe hanging out with harry anderson.</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: nice save lol</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: but u dont need to worry abt busting us outta space jail tbh</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: thats not ur problem to fix</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: oh.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: i'm... not sure i follow, then.</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: i mean yeah ur gonna obvs facilitate it in a sense</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: but only by going and busting the person who can actually help us outta normal earth jail</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: we need yoU to free vriska from the clUtches of oUr misgUided friend jane, and bring her here, to the singUlarity.</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: weve been calling it the plot point</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: yes, the plot point is a key part of oUr plan. </p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: as far as we have been able to sUrmise, the only remaining method for escaping oUr grim confinement depends on leveraging the UniqUe properties of this location to create an event of sUch catalcysmic proportions that it simply cannot be contained within the black hole any more.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: something SO dramatic, so hyper-relevant, that it becomes ontologically impossible for anyone to ignore it.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: for that, we need an individUal of sUfficient narrative cloUt, so to speak.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: and to liberate her, who better than the embodiment of the aspect of freedom itself?</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: ...</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: phew. okay, i'm finished.</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: <mops brow=\"\"></mops></p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: sorry, that took longer than i expected to go throUgh.</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: what r u talking about cals that was great</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: i could listen 2 u plotsplain for years</p><p class=\"calliope\">CALLIOPE: oh you &gt;u&lt;</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: fyi this was why i wanted u to get a move on eggbread</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: so callie could have more time 2 infodump</p><p class=\"roxy\">ROXY: thats love bitchhhhhh</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: hahaha.</p><p class=\"john\">JOHN: ok, well, i think i understood all that?</p></div></div><div class=\"epilogue o_epilogue type-rg type-sm--md line-caption mine-copy--md\"><p class=\"no-indent\">In reality, John isn’t sure what most of this means. But on balance, it feels okay? He’s gone back and forth about a hundred times in the last week about where his place in everything is, so he might as well ride this out. Plus, the last time a Lalonde kind of told him to do something, he thinks that he chose not to, and look where that got him. And it’s not like he has other plans. He may as well do this! It’s at least going to get him involved in things again, if nothing else. He turns to go, and then hears a sound. It’s the sound of feet and knocking on doors, echoed through stone and digital static.</p></div>"
